accompanying documentation provided herewith, including (but not limited to)
assembly instructions, photographs, video guides, and bills of materials,

remedial works to be usable, the cost of any and all such works shall be borne
by you, including (but not limited to) the cost of creating new PCB designs,
ordering new PCBs or sourcing additional components.

3. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK: Assembling electronic apparatuses of any kind,
especially those that are mains-powered, carries an inherent risk of injury,
potentially leading to death. It is generally assumed that any such activity
should be undertaken only by suitably qualified persons. If you attempt to use
the project files to build your own electronic device(s), you do so entirely at
your own risk. In no event shall the copyright holder(s) be held responsible for
your safety and well-being.

aforementioned notices and identification marks from the PCB artwork(s) or the
finished product(s).

5. REDISTRIBUTION: You are free to redistribute the project files provided that:

      copyright notices included with the project.
